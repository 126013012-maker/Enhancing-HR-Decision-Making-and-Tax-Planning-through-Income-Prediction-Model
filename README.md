# Enhancing-HR-Decision-Making-and-Tax-Planning-through-Income-Prediction-Model

This project builds a machine learning-based web application to predict whether an individual's income is above or below 50K/year based on demographic and work-related features. It helps HR departments in automated screening and aids in tax planning decisions.

 Features

- Predict income category: `<=50` or `>50K`
- Uses Logistic Regression with preprocessing pipeline
- Simple and interactive interface (Gradio)
- Cleaned and processed Adult dataset (`adult 3.csv`)
- Ready for deployment and future enhancements
